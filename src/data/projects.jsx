    duration: undefined,
    techStack: ["Swift","CoreML","AVFoundation","Speech"],
    details: (<>
  <p><strong>Situation:</strong>  Emotional wellness journaling apps often lack natural input methods and intelligent mood analysis.</p>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong>  Users found traditional journaling tedious and emotion tracking inconsistent or non-personalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Action:</strong>  Built an iOS app that uses AVFoundation for voice recording, Speech framework for transcription, and CoreML for sentiment classification.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong>  Delivered a hands-free journaling experience with auto-tagged moods and visual emotional trends over time.</p>
  <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong>  Gained practical knowledge in CoreML integration, audio preprocessing, and user-friendly visualization of emotion data.</p>
